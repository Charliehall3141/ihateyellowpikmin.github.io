<h1 class="overlay_black">WHY I HATE THE DIRTY BASTARD OF A YELLOW PIKMIN AND WANT TO MURDER IT WITH
     MY OWN TWO HANDS

</h1>


<p class="dotted">Yellow Pikmin, with their bulbous heads and perpetually 
    surprised expressions, are the bane of my existence. 
    Their sole purpose seems to be acting as living 
    batteries, powering up those infernal electric 
    gates that block my path. Sure, they can be 
    thrown higher than other Pikmin, but that's 
    hardly a redeeming quality when you consider 
    their utter uselessness in combat. 
    Their punches are weaker than a toddler's, and their
    only defense mechanism is cowering in fear. And don't eve
    n get me started on their speed or lack thereof. Watching
    them waddle across the landscape is like watching paint dry. If I could 
    eliminate one species of Pikmin from existence, 
    those yellow nuisances would be at the top of my list.</p>

    <h2>AN ESSAY WRITTEN BY A RELIABLE SOURCE TALKING ABOUT THE YELLOW PIKMIN AND WHY IT SHOULD BE KILLED</h2>

    <p class="essay">As the world of Pikmin continues to captivate and enthral gamers worldwide, 
        the topic of discussion among die-hard fans has shifted to the inferiority of the yellow Pikmin.
        While the other colored Pikmin have unique abilities and strengths,
        the yellow Pikmin seem to be the outcasts, providing little to no practical use to players.
        This essay will argue that all yellow Pikmin are, in fact, the worst and will support this 
        claim with five compelling paragraphs. <br><br></p>

    <p class="essay">Firstly, the yellow Pikmin's primary function is to carry items,
         but they are the slowest and weakest of the lot. They cannot lift heavy objects
         , making them useless when it comes to moving large boulders, structures,
          or objects that require more strength. Furthermore, their speed is excruciatingly slow,
           which makes them easy prey for enemy forces and slower in completing tasks.
            This lack of speed also makes them difficult to control,
         making it challenging for players to direct them to specific areas<br><br></p>

    <p class="essay">Secondly, the yellow Pikmin's defense mechanism is non-existent. While the other Pikmin have unique
        abilities such as spit, bounce, and fly, the yellow Pikmin have nothing to offer in terms of defense.
        They cannot fend off enemies or protect other Pikmin from harm, making them a liability in battle
        situations. Their vulnerabilityto attacks from enemies puts the rest of the Pikmin at risk,
        as they become easy targets.<br><br></p>

    <p class="essay">Thirdly, the yellow Pikmin's lifespan is short, making them a temporary solution at best.
         Unlike the other Pikmin, which can last for several days, the yellow Pikmin have a lifespan
          of only one day. This short lifespan makes them less effective as they do not have enough
           time to complete tasks or contribute significantly to the overall mission.
           This also means that players must spend more time and resources breeding them,
         which is a waste of time and resources that could be utilized elsewhere.<br><br></p>

    <p class="essay"> the yellow Pikmin's inability to transform or mutate into more effective forms
         is a significant disadvantage. The other Pikmin can evolve into more powerful forms,
        such as the The yellow Pikmin, however, remain stagnant and do not offer any unique abilities
        or any usefull skills making them completely useles<br><br></p>
